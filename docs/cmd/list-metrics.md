# list-metrics

## Description

This command just uses the [general options](/cmd/). It connects to the
vCenter and fetches a list of
[PerfCounterInfos](https://vdc-repo.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/1ef6c336-7bef-477d-b9bb-caa1767d7e30/82521f49-9d9a-42b7-b19b-9e6cd9b30db1/vim.PerformanceManager.html#field_detail)
and displays them to you, so you can make use of them with the
[perf](/cmd/perf) command.
